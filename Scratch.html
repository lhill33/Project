        <div id="LIV Golf" class="Subtitle">A Hard Choice for Players: PGA vs. LIV Golf</div>

        In recent years, the golf world has been captivated by a burgeoning rivalry that has shaken the foundations of
        the sport: the PGA Tour versus LIV Golf. This clash of titans has sparked passionate debates among players,
        fans, and industry insiders, marking a new era in professional golf. LIV Golf, backed by significant funding and a bold vision, burst onto the scene with promises of innovation
        and disruption. Its format, which includes team-based competition and shorter events, offers a stark contrast to
        the traditional structure of the PGA Tour. By positioning itself as a fresh alternative, LIV Golf has sought to
        attract not only new audiences but also some of the sport’s biggest stars. At the heart of the rivalry is the migration of high-profile players. For decades, the PGA Tour has been the
        pinnacle of professional golf, offering prestige and tradition. However, LIV Golf’s lucrative contracts and
        unique format have enticed a growing number of athletes to make the switch. This exodus has intensified
        competition and fueled speculation about the future of both leagues.
